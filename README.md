# Coronal mass ejection prediction  
Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) is a significant release of plasma and accompanying magnetic field from the Sun's corona into the heliosphere, which are often associated with solar flares and other forms of solar activity. Some CME can cause technological malfunctions which will lead to many dangers. It might also cause surges in electrical currents which overload power grids causing widespread blackouts. Thus, it is important to detect the CME because observing CME phenomena in advance may reduce the damage from the above phenomenon. In the last decades, CME has been routinely detected by visual inspection of each image from the Large Angle Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO). We decided to use machine learning to help us classify the solar flare images to positive (with CME) and negative (without CME). 

Firstly, we transferred the image to polar coordinates, which got rid of the unrelated part and transferred the shape of the ROI region to a rectangle. After that, we cropped the ROI from the polar coordinates image. Then we extracted the texture and greyscale features which could present the CME phenomenon. We extracted three kinds of features including LBP, HOG, HIST, and we also integrated these three features to train the classifier models. We tested the four kinds of features and the LBP feature got the best prediction performance. 

Then we plan to use SVM, KNN and CNN classifiers to classify our data. To get better performance, we used cross-validation to get the best penalty value C for our SVM model, and the best k-neighbour value for our KNN model. We tested many neural network architectures to optimise the   performance of CNN. The LBP feature was used to train and test the four models and the SVM classifier showed the best performance, the CNN also performs well.
